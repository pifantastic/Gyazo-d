I use @cowboy's awesome hack [here](http://benalman.com/news/2009/10/gyazo-on-your-own-server/) 
to upload images I create with [Gyazo](http://gyazo.com/en) to my own server. After
awhile a lot of images were accumulating and I wanted a simple way to browse through
them quickly.  So I created this.  Just plop it onto your server (assuming PHP is 
available) inside a directory with images.
